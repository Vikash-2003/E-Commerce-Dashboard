## Project Title
Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis in E-Commerce

## Project Description
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis to segment customers in an e-commerce setting. Using historical transactional data, the goal is to identify high-value, loyal, at-risk, and dormant customers, enabling the business to tailor marketing strategies for improved retention, reduced churn, and increased lifetime value.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from Dashboard
*Recency – Average days since last purchase per customer segment.

*Frequency – Average number of purchases made by each segment.

*Monetary Value – Total spending per segment.

*Customer Segment Distribution – Percentage of customers in High Value, Loyal, At-Risk, Dormant categories.

*Revenue Contribution by Segment – Share of total revenue generated by each customer group.

*Pareto Analysis – Percentage of customers/products contributing to 80% of revenue.

## Process of the Dashboard
*Data Collection – Kaggle E-commerce dataset (541,909 rows, 8 columns, Dec 2010 – Dec 2011).

*Data Cleaning & Preparation

*Removed rows with missing CustomerID (24.93% missing).

*Removed 5,525 duplicate transactions.

*Excluded 8,872 cancelled orders (InvoiceNo starting with “C”).

*Dropped non-product StockCodes.

*Feature Engineering – Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.

*RFM Scoring – Assigned scores from 1–5 for each RFM metric, then summed to create an RFM score.

*Segmentation – Divided customers into 4 key groups: High Value, Loyal, At-Risk, Dormant.

*Dashboard Creation – Visualized KPIs using heatmaps, bar charts, and segment breakdowns.

*Insights & Recommendations – Developed targeted strategies for each customer type.

## Project Insights
*26% of customers generate 80% of revenue → a small set of high-value customers drive most sales.

*21% of products generate 80% of revenue → indicates a need to prioritize top-selling items.

*High Value customers have low recency, high frequency, and high monetary scores, making them brand advocates.

*Dormant customers show long inactivity and low spending, requiring re-engagement campaigns.

*At-Risk customers can be converted back with personalized promotions and reminders.

*Loyal customers are prime candidates for upselling and cross-selling opportunities.

## Final Conclusion
Implementing RFM-based segmentation in e-commerce provides data-driven insights for targeted marketing. By focusing on high-value customers and strategically re-engaging at-risk or dormant customers, businesses can maximize revenue, improve retention, and optimize marketing spend. This approach not only boosts customer lifetime value but also aligns business resources with the most impactful customer groups.
